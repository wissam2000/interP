# Overview:
  This python script will take as input a url to a json type file with the desired format.
  The script will then allow the user to explore the data by optionally filtering by class, type, and repo.
  The script will print the data to stdout and save it to a file named "data.json"
  Note that the script allows for combined criteria.
